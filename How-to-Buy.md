## How to Buy a Power Bank?

Parameters need to check before buying Power Bank
- **Capacity:** The most important feature, measured in **milliampere-hour (mAh)**.
  - Ask Yourself: What is your device battery capacity?
  - Examples
    - 10,000 mAh ~ 3 Phone Charges
    - 20,000 mAh ~ 6 Phone Charges
    - 30,000 mAh ~ 9 Phone Charges (not allowed in airplane)
- Efficiency: Look for a high efficiency rating to maximize power delivery.
  - **Power Output:** How much power comes out from power bank to charge your device.
    - Which measured in **watts (W)**
    - For Laptop - It requires minimum 100W or above of power
    - For Smartphone - It requires 18W and above of power
  - Tech
    - Li-ion (Lithium-Ion) cells - ?
- Charging speed: Consider how quickly it charges your devices.
  - **Power Input / Charging Time:** How much time it would take to recharge the power bank
    - Example
      - 10,000 mAh take 2-3 hours or faster to recharge
- Compatibility: Ensure it works with your devices.
  - USB-C is most standard in all devices
  - No of Ports: More ports = more devices you can charge
- Portability: Choose a size that suits your lifestyle.
  - Weight and Volume
    - More mAh power bank has, the heavier and bulkier it tends to be
- Brand: Opt for a trusted brand for reliability.
  - Need to consider Build Quality
- Other Parameters
  - **Pass-through charging:** The capability of the power bank to charge one or more other devices, while it’s being charged itself
  - **Safety features:** Overcharge protection, over-discharge protection, short circuit protection, shock protection, etc.
  - LCD screen - Will it cost more?
  - Solar Charging - Will it cost more?
  - Water proof - Will it cost more?
  - Flashlight - Do we really need it?
  - It doesn't end there though. You still need to consider other factors like heat loss, resistance, and the product's degeneration over time.

**FAQ's**
- How Many mAh Do You Need To Charge Your Phone?
  - Basically, the amount of capacity (mAh) you need to charge a phone depends on the capacity (mAh) of the phone’s battery. Some phone models need more mAh to get charged while others require less.
- Should You Drain Your Power Bank Before Charging?
  - It’s not a good idea to drain your power bank all the way down to 0%. Especially if you do so on a regular basis. As much as possible try to recharge it when it drops under 20%.
  - At least, try to recharge it before it drops under 10%
- How can I check my mobile power bank capacity?
  - Luckily, there is a way to estimate how many times a power bank can charge based on its capacity. Consider the 5000mAh power bank once again.
  - How many full charge is 5000mah power bank?
    - In this case, the total energy is 5000mAh x 3.7V = 18500mWh. Now we need to convert the capacity at 5V to 18500mWH / 5V = 3700mAh.
    - What is 3.7V and 5V values? <sup>[3]</sup>
- Should I buy old power bank for low price?
  - You should also avoid buying power banks that run on older technology such as outdated ports (i.e. micro USB) or very slow charging times. If you’re going to buy a new device, why not get the advantages of the new tech as well?
