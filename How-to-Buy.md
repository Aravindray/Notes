**FAQ's**
- How Many mAh Do You Need To Charge Your Phone?
  - Basically, the amount of capacity (mAh) you need to charge a phone depends on the capacity (mAh) of the phone’s battery. Some phone models need more mAh to get charged while others require less.
- Should You Drain Your Power Bank Before Charging?
  - It’s not a good idea to drain your power bank all the way down to 0%. Especially if you do so on a regular basis. As much as possible try to recharge it when it drops under 20%.
  - At least, try to recharge it before it drops under 10%
- How can I check my mobile power bank capacity?
  - Luckily, there is a way to estimate how many times a power bank can charge based on its capacity. Consider the 5000mAh power bank once again.
  - How many full charge is 5000mah power bank?
    - In this case, the total energy is 5000mAh x 3.7V = 18500mWh. Now we need to convert the capacity at 5V to 18500mWH / 5V = 3700mAh.
    - What is 3.7V and 5V values? <sup>[3]</sup>
- Should I buy old power bank for low price?
  - You should also avoid buying power banks that run on older technology such as outdated ports (i.e. micro USB) or very slow charging times. If you’re going to buy a new device, why not get the advantages of the new tech as well?
